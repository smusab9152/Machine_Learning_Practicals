About The Project
This project serves as a practical guide to several fundamental supervised learning algorithms. Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm, walking through the process of data loading, model training, and evaluation on a real-world dataset.

üöÄ Practicals Included
Support Vector Classification (SVC) for Binary-Class Classification

File: SVC Binary-Class Classification.ipynb

Description: This notebook implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for a binary classification task. It demonstrates how to train an SVC model to distinguish between two classes, using the Breast Cancer dataset for prediction.

Concepts: Supervised Learning, Classification, Support Vector Machines, Kernel Trick.

Continuous Naive Bayes Classifier

File: Continuos Naive Bayes.ipynb

Description: An implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, which is suitable for continuous data. The notebook applies this probabilistic classifier to a dataset to make predictions.

Concepts: Supervised Learning, Classification, Bayes' Theorem, Naive Bayes, Gaussian Distribution.

Anomaly Detection

File: Anomaly Detection.ipynb

Description: This practical explores the concept of identifying rare items or outliers in a dataset. It provides a hands-on example of an anomaly detection algorithm to flag unusual data points.

Concepts: Unsupervised Learning, Outlier Detection, Density Estimation.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) and pip installed on your system.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/smusab9152/Machine_Learning_Practicals.git](https://github.com/smusab9152/Machine_Learning_Practicals.git)
